        <h1>CVD DIAMOND MANUFACTURING PROCESS</h1>
        <p>
            In the process of creating these man made diamonds, the extremely pure carbon-rich gases are stored and
            controlled in a chamber. These carbon-rich gases like Methane are heated to approximately 800 degree
            Celsius. These gases then break apart enabling the carbon atoms to separate within the gas. The carbon atoms
            then fall on to a diamond substrate starting to create layers, resulting in a diamond crystal. It takes six
            to ten weeks for CVD rough diamond manufacturer to process and further create Type IIa diamonds.
        </p>

        <p>
            Lab-Grown diamonds are categorized as the quality diamonds. And with having Type IIa, you can certify them
            as the purest form of diamonds. Also, they are not only harder than traditional type Ia diamonds but, also
            more brilliance or shinier. According to researches, only 2% of mined diamonds have this kind of perfection.
        </p>

        <p>
            Lab-Grown diamonds impact minimum on the earth and society. For every 1 Carat Lab grown diamonds, there is
            approximately 0.007 square meter of land that is getting disturbed and 70 liters of water that is being
            used.
        </p>
        <p>It is a most curious question asked by many, and the answer is only predictable for natural diamonds;
            billions to thousands of times have been taken from carbon to rough stone diamond from creation under the
            earth ground. But synthetic lab-grown one takes almost 4 weeks; this process is under the lab chamber
            without a flawless problem. There are two types of a procedure; one known is High-Pressure High Temperature
            or HPHT. The second method for creating lab diamonds is Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD).
